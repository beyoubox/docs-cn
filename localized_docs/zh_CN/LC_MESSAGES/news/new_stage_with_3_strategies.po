"Since the :ref:`stoken_sale`, the Beyou Network project has received much "
"attention. Under the multi-dimensional and wide-ranging awareness, the "
"Beyou Network has won the favor of a group of holders with beyou. They not"
" only bought Stokens but also sent emails to provide advice on community "
"governance and ecological construction."

"At the same time, more and more members have joined the volunteer work of "
"the Stoken community. They have done a lot of experimental, exploratory, and "
"far-sighted practical work, which has provided an excellent imperative for "
"the whole ecological construction."

"At present, the Beyou Network has more than 30 stable test nodes all over "
"the world, which provides a fundamental basis for the smooth use and in-"
"depth development of the network in the future. We are also happy to see the"
" massive user and activity data: more than 2,600 users have entree to the "
"test-net, averaging 1.9 hours per day. In the current situation where the "
"vnCHAIN is under development, it is beneficial to have such data for every "
"user."

"As we all know, since the public sale, we have encountered some unforeseen "
"troubles. The most challenging thing is that the centralized exchanges "
"forced the listing of the Stoken. It not only interrupted our sales plan but "
"also brought some holders in the loss of interest. Our original plan was to "
"announce the exchange whitelist plan after the 10th season and start the "
"trading market in an orderly manner. Why should we start the trading plan at"
" a particular stage, to maximize the protection of the holder's profits? "
"However, due to the open-source feature of Stoken, many exchanges forcibly "
"meddled the ecology, without approved. They also disrupted the market price,"
" which has brought many troubles to the public-sale and community "
"foundation."

"A project without value never gets noticed, and many exchanges have seen the"
" value of the Beyou Network project, which is an excellent performance for "
"the industry. In the prior time, some exchanges have also used their traffic"
" to drive, which is worth affirming. However, according to our observations,"
" some unknown exchanges produced a large amount of fake Stokens and data. "
"That is not consistent with the actual circumstance of the market, because "
"some people want to create panic to gain personal benefit. It also confirms "
"our speculation, but at that time, we did not have rather data, and it is "
"not advisable to make arbitrary conclusions by guessing. That is why we made"
" a global announcement, rejected some of the community members' requests for"
" us to manipulate the market to drive prices. Therefore, we lost some "
"supporters who thought we were not following the advice. However, the real "
"situation is that we don't want all the participants to run hard, but only "
"the exchanges get the benefits. No matter who plays in the market price "
"manipulation, the profiteering party can only be the exchange, not the "
"holders of Stoken."
