"Since the Stoken public-sale, the Beyou Network project has received much "
"attention. Under the multi-dimensional and wide-ranging awareness, the "
"Beyou Network has won the favor of a group of holders with beyou. They not"
" only bought Stoken but also sent emails to provide advices on community "
"governance and ecological construction."

"As we all know, since the public sale, we have encountered some unforeseen "
"troubles. The most challenging thing is that the centralized exchanges "
"forced the listing of the Stoken. It not only interrupted our sales plan but "
"also brought some holders in the loss of interest. Our original plan was to "
"announce the exchange whitelist plan after the 10th season and start the "
"trading market in an orderly manner. Why should we start the trading plan at"
" a particular stage, to maximize the protection of the holder's profits! "
"However, due to the open-source feature of Stoken, many exchanges forcibly "
"meddled the ecology, without approved. They also disrupted the market price,"
" which has brought many troubles to the public-sale and community "
"foundation."

"A project without value never gets noticed, and many exchanges have seen the"
" value of the Beyou Network project, which is an excellent performance for "
"the industry. In the prior time, some exchanges have also used their traffic"
" to drive, which is worth affirming. However, according to our observations,"
" some unknown exchanges produced a large amount of fake Stoken and data. That"
" is not consistent with the actual circumstance of the market, because some "
"people want to create panic to gain personal benefit. It also confirms our "
"speculation, but at that time, we did not have rather data, and it is not "
"advisable to make arbitrary conclusions by guessing. That is why we made a "
"global announcement, rejected some of the community members' requests for us"
" to manipulate the market to drive prices. Therefore, we lost some "
"supporters who thought we were not following the advice. However, the real "
"situation is that we don't want all the participants to run hard, but only "
"the exchanges get the benefits. No matter who plays in the market price "
"manipulation, the profiteering party can only be the exchange, not the "
"holders of Stoken."

"We know something: our team is good at technology, but not good at bragging "

"A large-scale, healthy, and ecological creation and growth must take a "
"certain amount of time, which requires the efforts of many people. Stoken's "
"early low-price sales reserved plenty of profit room for subsequent growth, "
"which should be shared by all eco-participants. Moreover, the current number"
" of users is not enough. In the past, we have seen many holders impulsively "
"selling; they did not understand the project in-depth and were also affected"
